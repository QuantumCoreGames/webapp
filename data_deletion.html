    <h1>Data Deletion Policy</h1>

    <p>This page is provided to comply with the data deletion request requirements set forth by Facebook.</p>

    <h2>Our App's Data Collection Policy</h2>

    <p>We want to be perfectly clear about how your data is handled:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>No Explicit Data Collection:</strong> Our application is designed to function without collecting, storing, or processing any personal user data. It does not require a login, user accounts, or any explicit personal information (such as name, email, or physical location) to operate.</li>
        <li><strong>No Data Storage:</strong> Because we do not collect data, there is no user data stored on our servers for deletion.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Third-Party Data Collection</h2>

    <p>While our application itself does not collect personal data, it does integrate with third-party services that may collect and process data for operational purposes:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Advertising (AdMob):</strong> We use Google AdMob for displaying advertisements. AdMob may collect data (such as device identifiers and IP address) to serve relevant ads and measure performance. Please refer to the <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google Privacy Policy</a> for more details.</li>
        <li><strong>Social Platform Integration (Facebook):</strong> Integration with Facebook is limited to necessary platform functions. Facebook may collect data according to their own policies. Please refer to the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy/" target="_blank">Facebook Data Policy</a> for details on their data handling and deletion processes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Deletion Request</h2>

    <p>If you have interacted with our app and wish to formally request the deletion of any data that might have been collected by the third-party platforms (Facebook, AdMob, etc.) through our app, please contact us directly.</p>
